### Restaurant Review: Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree project
    
This is Restaurant Reviews project, One of prjects in Udacity FEND nanodegree. I incrementally converted a static wepage to a mobile-ready web application. In first stage, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a server workder. I used asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. I stored data received from the server in an offline database.
